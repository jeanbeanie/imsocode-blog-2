# Im So Code (http://imsocode.com) ✌🏽🌺

A blog about code, created as an excuse to use my starter seed app : https://github.com/jeanbeanie/mern_starter_app

To my starting base, I added MongoDB for this project. The posts for this blog are currently added and managed in a separate MERN project I created that I will be rewriting using the new and improved starter seed app as a base.
