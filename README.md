# Im So Code (imsocode.com)

Created as an excuse to use my seed starter app which uses Node (Express) and React (server side rendering)

----------------

Webpack/Babel (hot reloading) is set up for development. Ava is included for test running.

#### Create a config file at src/config.js (see config.example.js) then just add water
> ```npm install```

> ```npm start``` 

#### Run tests
> ```npm test```

> ```npm watch```
