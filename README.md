# Im So Code (imsocode.com)

Created as an excuse to use my seed starter app which uses Node (Express) and React (server side rendering)

----------------

Webpack/Babel (hot reloading) is set up for development. Ava is included for test running.

#### Just add water
> ```npm install --save```

> ```npm start``` 

#### Run tests
> ```npm test```

> ```npm watch```
